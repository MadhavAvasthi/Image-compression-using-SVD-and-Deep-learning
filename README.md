Description:
The link contains the dataset created for the paper and the algorithm. 
The dataset contains over 1500 high-resolution images clicked from mobile phones acquired from 18 handsets from 10 different cities with the aim of having a real-life mobile image dataset. The file is divided into two parts, i.e., Image dataset 1 and Image dataset 2.
The file also contains the code for the paper. 
"SVD for image compression .ipynb" provides the code for image compression using SVD.
The dataset containing more than 1500 images is processed to this code, and the results are collected into an excel sheet named "Dataset Information for RESNET.xlsx".
Further, the data from this excel sheet is used to train the deep learning model presented in "SVD_RESNET.ipynb."
